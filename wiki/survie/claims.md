# Claims

### The basis of claiming

The Claim System works with **chunks**, 
:::What is a **Chunk**?
A chunk is a square of 16x16 with no height limitation. These chunks are defined by minecraft, you can use the `F3+G` key combination to see them.
:::
To create your first claim, you will need to do `/c claim`. When this is done, you now need to create a *claim chest*, this will be the heart of your claim. This chest will allow you to supply your claim in ressources like copper, iron, diamonds or cobble (We recommend using copper ðŸ¤“). To create your claim chest, you will need to craft a normal minecraft chest and put the recources like in the image bellow.

You can also get the recipe by using the `/c recipe` command.

### Enlarge the claim

To enlarge your claim, stand in the adjacent chunk and repeat the `/c claim` command. The claims will merge automatically.

### Authorize a friend to build

Stand in your claim and use `/c invite <player>` to invite a new builder. Your friend will need to do `/c accept` to join it.
