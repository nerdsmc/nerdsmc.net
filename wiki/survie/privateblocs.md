# PrivateBlocs

The PrivateBlocs are used to protect a particular block like a chest, furnace, door et cetera to prevent people visiting your claim to use or steal stuff.

To create a protected block, you need to place a sign on it by shift-clicking and write 
```
[Protect]
Nickname 
Nickname2 (optional)
Nickname3 (optional)
```

Tip: You can rapidly protect a block by clicking directly on it with a sign in hand, no need to write anything.
